Hello, traveller... *thinks* We have ... such a nice village... Errgh, can't keep up with this sweettalk crap. Whatu want?
*laughs sarcastically* Very funny, no really. Why don't you go ahead and tell another one?

Enough with this nonsense, iam not here to be your joke-doll. Get out of my sight's before i make you!
Yeah, is that so. Hmm, you think your so tough, huh?  *tries to imitate you* Walking around like that, feeling so powerful.
But guess what, you never fought for anything, lost something dear anything, couldn't save someone close...
I know you're not an ordinary traveller, coming here for food and relaxation. But you're not what you think, a hero. Let me give you a little advice:
In the end the world just wants to eat you up, and it will - everyone dies one day. It's just about holding on and fighting, till you can't.
So come back if you've proven anything, otherwise showing you the way is a waste of time - you'll just end up being another dead body I have to scrape of the road the next day.
